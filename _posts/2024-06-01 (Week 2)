title: Week 2
---

After orientation week, we were all ready to get to know our project and teams better. This week, I had the opportunity to try the ASL Champ! game using the Oculus Quest 3 headset. It was an exciting and immersive experience that inspired me to learn more about sign recognition and the application of deep learning in assistive technologies.

Playing ASL Champ! made me realize the potential of VR in educational tools  and how advanced algorithms can be used to create more inclusive digital environments. While this game is still in its early stages of development with 9 signs in a coffee shop environment, it is inspiring to be part of a project with so much potential.

I also began my literature review for my Accessible Information and Communication Technologies (AICT) requirement. This involved researching current methodologies in sign language recognition, the challenges faced in developing accurate models, and the latest advancements in machine learning. 


I am looking forward to more weeks of learning!
