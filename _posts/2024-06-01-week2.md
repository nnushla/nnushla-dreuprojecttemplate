The first week of my DREU internship comprised of introductions and orientations where I learned about ongoing projects in Accessible Information and Communication Technologies at Gallaudet University. I was also assigned to an exciting project called ASL Champ! 

The team has developed a fully functional ASL learning game in VR.  This initiative focuses on creating an accessible and engaging platform for learning American Sign Language (ASL). The game uses an interactive approach where users learn ASL signs from a signing avatar.

My role over the summer will be in assisting the team to train datasets of ASL signs to power a sign recognition model across different VR environments.
