This week, me and my team worked on the literature review draft. We looked into existing research in sign language recognition systems with a focus in the use of virtual reality (VR) platforms for teaching American Sign Language (ASL) and how it presents potential for enhancing the learning experience for users. We were able to assess various methods of powering the sign language recognition system and learned more about the use of deep learning algorithms for ASL Champ! I read a lot of insightful papers and had to choose the 15 most relevant research works for this literature review. I also looked into the future scope of research for sentences recognition in sign language as well as improvement in recognition accuracy.

We also formed our own research question about the sigificance/role of quality and diversity of datasets in virtual reality (VR) platforms in affecting the usability and learning experience of American Sign Language (ASL) learners. I am looking forward to conducting the study and evaluating the user experience in the next few weeks.
